                    <h1>What is Christmas?</h1>
                    <P> Christmas is the most awaited holiday for most people, epecially the Filipinos. This is considered to be the season of giving and spending time with the family. With that in mind, Christmas is celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, whichi is on every December 25 every year. It follows the Christmas Eve which is celebrate on December 24 every year as well. . Perhaps the practice of celebrating the evening before the big day is an echo from ancient Jewish reckoning. Among earlier Jews, a day began at six in the evening and ran until six the following evening. Had not Moses written: "An evening and a morning were the first day"?
                        <br>
                        Christmas means "Christ-mass." Although the date is a guess, the tradition of observing it goes back to at least the fourth century. Under the influence of the church, Christian traditions replaced pagan solstice festivals throughout Europe. Often the more innocent pagan practices (such as bringing in a Yule log, decorating with holly and the like) were carried over into the Christmas observance, transfigured with new meaning.

                    <h1> Famous Symbols</h1>
                    <p><b>Evergreen Trees</b> were the symbol of eternal life. Martin Luther introduced them to the Reformation Church as a picture of our endless life in Christ, by bringing in a tree to his family on Christmas Eve lit with candles (Isaiah 60:13).<br>

                        <b>Candles</b> are a picture that Christ is the Light of the world (John 8).<br>
                        

                        <b>Red</b> is a color of Christmas that speaks of Christ's blood and death.<br>

                       <b> Gifts</b> are a reminder of the gifts of the Magi to baby Jesus. Each of them speak to a component of His incarnation: Majesty in life, Bitterest Agony in Death and He as God's Perfect gift to us (Matthew 2). <br>
